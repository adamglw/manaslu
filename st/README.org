* Manaslu color theme patch for st
** Intallation
   - Download the patch.diff file.
   - Use the ~patch~ program to apply the patch to st as follows,
     #+begin_src sh
       cd path/to/st
       patch -p1 < path/to/downloaded/patch.diff
     #+end_src
   - If patching fails there are probably too many patches already applied to your build of st. Manual patching by inspecting the diff should be quite easy in this case.
