* Manaslu color theme patch for st
  st, or simple terminal, is a terminal emulator for the X Window System developed by [[https://suckless.org][suckless.org]].

  st is minimal by default but it's easy to add functionality via patches.

  This patch applies the Manaslu color theme to st.
  
** Intallation
*Prerequisites:* st must already be downloaded, see [[https://st.suckless.org][st.suckless.org]] for download.

- Download the patch.diff file.
- Use the ~patch~ program to apply the patch to st as follows,
     #+begin_src sh
       cd path/to/st
       patch -p1 < path/to/downloaded/patch.diff
       #+end_src
- Remove the config.def file if it already exists.
- Compile and install st: ~sudo make clean install~.
       
If patching fails there are probably too many patches already applied to your build of st. Manual patching by inspecting the diff should be quite easy in this case.
